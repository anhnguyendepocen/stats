<h2 id="sec-2">Welcome</h2>

<p>
Welcome to Introduction to Statistics Using R (Psychology 9041B) for
the winter term, 2017.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this one-semester graduate seminar is to provide you with
a deeper understanding of the logic behind statistical analyses of
data, to learn a set of standard statistical techniques, and to gain
hands-on experience using the R language for statistical computing and
graphical displays of data. We will cover an initial set of core
topics including sampling distributions, t-tests, ANOVA (and some of
its many variants), multiple comparisons &amp; post-hoc tests, and
multiple regression. We also cover a set of other topics pertinent to
modern research in neuroscience such as maximum-likelihood estimation,
bootstrapping and resampling techniques, and bayesian approaches to
data analysis and modeling.
</p>

<p>
There will be a significant hands-on practical aspect to the course,
namely learning to use the <a href="http://r-project.org">R</a> language for statistical computation and
graphical display of data. No prior experience with R is required.
</p>

<p>
If your statistical background is limited, you will benefit greatly
from this course, which focuses on the logic of statistical analysis,
using a practical, hands-on approach focusing on real-world
applications in research.
</p>

<p>
If you have had some of these topics before in previous courses, you
will probably still benefit greatly from covering the same ground, in
a different way. You will also learn to use R, which will serve you
very well in the future.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Potential list of topics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Here is a list of topics we could cover in the course. In the first
few classes we will discuss which topics to cover, and make a
collective decision based on the background and interests of the group
this year.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Scientific Method &amp; Statistical Reasoning
</li>
<li>Null Hypothesis Significance Tests (NHST), Sampling Distributions and the T-test
</li>
<li>Single Factor Between Subjects Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
</li>
<li>Multiple Comparisons, Type-I Error
</li>
<li>Two Factor and 3+ Factor ANOVA
</li>
<li>Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
</li>
<li>Repeated-Measures (Within Subjects) ANOVA
</li>
<li>Mixed (Between / Within) ANOVA
</li>
<li>Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA)
</li>
<li>Multiple Regression
</li>
<li>Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
</li>
<li>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
</li>
<li>Logistic Regression
</li>
<li>Bootstrapping and Resampling Techniques
</li>
<li>Intro to Bayesian Approaches
</li>
<li>Bayes: Computing the Posterior Using Conjugate Priors
</li>
<li>Bayes: Computing the Posterior Using Grid Approximation
</li>
<li>Bayes: Computing the Posterior Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Methods
</li>
<li>Machine Learning: clustering techniques
</li>
<li>Machine Learning: classification techniques
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is always a balance to be struck between breadth (number of
topics) and depth (level of detail), and given that this course is
presently offered as a one-semester course, there are limits to what
we can cover in sufficient detail. 
</p>

<p>
We will start out by considering the introductory topics in some
detail, and then we will go on to the more advanced topics, with less
detail, at least in class. You should explore topics that are relevant
to your own work in as much detail as you deem necessary, even if we
don't have time in class.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the semester we will talk about potential topics
and decide on a selection that best suits the class.

There is one <b>mandatory</b> textbook in this course. The Maxwell &amp;
Delaney book is a large book and very extensive, but I'm serious when
I say that I want you to do your best to read each section that is
assigned. You are taking a graduate course in statistics, and you have
a unique opportunity to dedicate a block of time each week to
consolidating the knowledge you already have, and to learn new things
about statistical analyses of data.
</p>

<p>
Some material from the Maxwell &amp; Delaney book will be provided on the
course webpage.
</p>

<p>
We will cover the initial set of core topics using the approach taken
in Maxwell &amp; Delaney:

The Keppel book is not mandatory but I would encourage you all to
acquire this book as well. It is a very good statistics text that
emphasizes computational formulae:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Design and Analysis: A Researcher's Handbook (4th Ed.) by Geoffrey
Keppel. Prentice Hall (2004).<br  />
  ISBN: 0135159415
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are many books on R, here is a decent one aimed at beginner users:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Beginner's Guide to R by Zuur, Ieno &amp; Meesters. Springer
(2009). ISBN: 9780387938363<br  />
  [ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387938362">buy it at amazon.com</a> ] [ <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-93836-3">read it online</a> ] [ <a href="http://www.highstat.com/book3.htm">code &amp; data</a> ]
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We will also be using a new texbook by Hadley Wickham &amp; Garrett
Grolemund called <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for Data Science</a>. You can buy a hardcopy from
Amazon but you can also view the entire book in html, using the above
link. The book is a good introduction to using R for data analysis and
visualization, and in particular we will be using it to learn about
data wrangling (loading in, and manipulating data) and data plotting
(using ggplot2).
</p>

<p>
Other selected readings will be assigned as appropriate for the topic
each week.

<h2 id="sec-6">Software</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
R is a sophisticated package for graphical and exploratory data
analysis, and is a powerful statistical programming language. R can be
downloaded for free for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Unix operating
systems from <a href="https://www.r-project.org"><a href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</a></a>. The R manual is also available
for free on the web. R code is platform-independent. R has extensive
on-line help, and there are lots of other resources on-line for using
R.
</p>

<p>
RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment
(IDE) for R. You can download it from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com"><a href="https://www.rstudio.com">https://www.rstudio.com</a></a>. I
recommend you use it, although if you prefer you can use the plain R
client above.
</p>

<p>
Note that all of the code and data files that are referred to in the
Zuur et al. (2009) text can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.highstat.com/book3.htm">http://www.highstat.com/book3.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
It's likely that none of you will have used R before, although some of
you may have used other statistical software packages (like SPSS), or
spreadsheet programs (like Excel) or even some numerical programming
languages (like Matlab). A non-trivial aspect of the work involved in
this course will be learning how to use R. There is a certain learning
curve involved with starting to program in any language. Once you
conquer that initial stage, your productivity will grow exponentially.
</p>

<p>
R is available for Macintosh OS X, Linux, and Windows. I have
experience with Mac OS X and with Linux. <i>I do not know anything about
Microsoft Windows</i> (apart from knowing that I don't want to use
it). If you choose to use Windows, my ability to help you troubleshoot
issues with software will be extremely limited. If you want to try
Linux without erasing your Windows partition, a good solution is to
use virtualization software such as <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> or <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, and install
Linux (e.g. <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>) on a virtual machine image.

<p>
The requirement for this course is simple: work diligently. This
includes attending class, doing the readings carefully before the
seminar meets, reading beyond the syllabus, working regularly on the
problem sets, practicing using statistical software, and coming to see
me for extra help, as needed. You will spend many hours learning and
using R to implement the concepts discussed in class. Because you each
have different backgrounds and interests, the amount of time necessary
to master the material will vary. That being said, I am confident that
with concerted effort each one of you can learn the material.
</p>

<p>
One important thing to realize: We will not have enough time in the
classes to go over the details of every concept covered in the
course. In class I will highlight the major ideas and provide a
conceptual roadmap for you to navigate through the material. You will
be responsible for reading the material in the textbooks on your own
and asking questions if you need more guidance. Just because I didn't
say it out loud in class doesn't mean you're not responsible for
it. Pay attention to the readings assigned for each week and do them
in advance of class, not afterwards.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt, there is a lot of reading assigned in this
course. Remember, you are a full time graduate student, your full time
job is to learn. Do the readings, they are a requirement of the
course.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to work together on the assignments. Just do not hand in a
document to me that is identical to someone else's. Also note that you
won't learn nearly as much if you simply copy someone else's work. You
will get the most out of this course if you work through the problem
sets on your own. Your goal here should not be to get a high
grade. Your goal should be to learn as much as you can.

<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9">Some Final Words</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Statistics (I have sometimes heard it called Sadistics) has a
reputation as a difficult topic, and one that depends on an
extraordinary mathematical or arithmetic ability. It's my hope that I
can convince you otherwise by the end of this course. Statistics is
often taught in a cookbook fashion, whereby you learn a series of
recipies that are often tied to particular software packages
(e.g. SPSS). Quite often you are evaluated (e.g. in exams or
assignments) based on your ability to recall memorized recipes and
equations, and / or to produce accurate arithmetic calculations. You
might even earn high grades in these courses, not because you
understand anything about statistics per se, but because you have
learned how to regurgitate statistical recipes and use a calculator.
</p>

<p>
Statistics, at its core, is not about calculation. Rather statistics
(at least the statistics we cover in this course) is a <i>logical
framework for interpreting data</i>. The key is to understand the <i>logic</i>
of statistical procedures. What I would like to drive home for you is
that an understanding of the logic behind statistics will empower you
in your future scientific endeavors. You will be able to incorporate
new statistical analyses into your own work, even if you haven't
formally learned about them before, because you will find that you
have insight into the fundamental logic behind them.
</p>

<p>
It's a cliche, but it's like the difference between being a cook and
being a chef. As a cook you know how to follow particular recipies but
you have little ability to flexibly adapt recipes for novel
situations, and you have little facility for developing your own new
recipies. As a chef you understand a core set of basic principles that
allows you to succeed in new environments by being creative (note that
being creative does not mean breaking rules, per se, but understanding
the ways in which you have flexibility, within the rules).
</p>

<p>
Being able to carry out statistical analyses of course depends on
computation, ultimately, but the <i>implementation</i> should be
independent of the statistical logic itself. In this course we will
focus largely on the logic of the statistical procedures we
cover. There will be a practical aspect as well, as we learn to use R
to implement statistical analyses &#x2026; but as you will see, R is built
on an extensive core of statistical smarts so that as a user, you
won't have to do much actual calculation yourself.
</p>

<p>
There is some degree of recipe-learning in any statistical software
package, whether it's SPSS or SAS or STATA or MATLAB or Python or
R&#x2014;but we will devote most of our time to talking about the logic
behind each procedure.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10">My Role and Your Role</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
My goal as instructor of this course is to <i>maximize your opportunity
to learn</i> both the fundamental logic and reason behind statistics, and
some practical tools (using R) for carrying out statistical analyses
and presenting data graphically. This is <b>not</b> an undergraduate-style
lecture course in which you can succeed by sitting back and memorizing
what I say. What you ultimately get out of this course depends, in the
end, on the efforts you put in to exploring the theoretical and
practical components of the course. I'm not going to tell you
everything you need to know. My role is more like a tour-guide,
showing you interesting topics and avenues that you will explore on
your own.
</p>

<p>
I am more than happy to spend some extra time with you going over
material and clarifying concepts that may be difficult to understand
at first. Often hearing something said in a new and different way will
help you gain a better understanding. I don't have formal office
hours; send me an email and we can schedule a time to meet. If there
is a clear need to go over material as a class, I am happy to arrange
extra tutorial sessions.
</p>

<p>
One of the challenges of a course like this is that each of you comes
to class with a different set of background skills and experiences
with statistics, with programming and with math. We will try to talk
about the ideas in such a way that it doesn't leave the beginners
behind, and at the same time it doesn't bore the life out of students
with more experience. Having said that, each of you has a
responsibility to take charge of your own experience. If you are
someone with less background and experience with these concepts, then
it is up to you to do the extra work to bring yourself up to
speed. You will find that this is not an uncommon feature of being a
researcher&#x2014;namely pulling yourself up by the boot-straps to learn
something new. I do it all the time and I'm old (!). For those of you
with more experience, it will be your responsibility to go the extra
mile, to dive deeper into the concepts that we touch on in class, to
learn the more advanced concepts and techniques. To put it bluntly, if
you're bored, then it's your responsibility to fix that problem. I'll
show you around the new neighborhoods but it's up to you to open the
doors, turn the corners and explore new avenues.
